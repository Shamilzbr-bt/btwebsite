                            An e-signature or electronic signature is an efficient and legal way to get electronic documents signed quickly. It is a cryptographic technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of digital documents and messages. By using a unique digital fingerprint, digital signatures ensure that the content has not been altered and that it originates from a verified source. This technology is widely used in various industries to enhance security, streamline workflows, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. It is a digital equivalent of a handwritten signature, but it offers more security and convenience.
